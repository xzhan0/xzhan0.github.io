- **MSCS Admission**
<br/>
I have been accepted into the Master of Science in Computer Science program at UIUC starting in Fall 2025. This is a fast paced program with a heavy focus on research, which might not be suitable for everyone. Thus, I am still actively seeking for PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2025.
