My name is Xianyang (Sam) Zhan (詹先洋), I am a Software Engineer II at Uber Freight, focusing on algorithm, strategy and machine learning engineering for freight pricing.

Prior to Uber Freight, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with highest honors at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in May 2025, advised by [Professor Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/). I also worked at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) as a research intern in Fall 2024, advised by [Professor Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html). My research area is NLP X HCI.
