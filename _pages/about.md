My name is Xianyang (Sam) Zhan (詹先洋), I am a Software Engineer II at Uber Freight, working on algorithm, strategy and machine learning engineering (ML safe deployment, feature engineering) for freight pricing.

Prior to Uber Freight, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with highest honors at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in May 2025, advised by [Professor Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/), I also worked closely with [Professor Eshwar Chandrasekharan](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com/). I worked at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)](https://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/24-25-academic-year-interns/) as a research intern in Fall 2024, advised by [Professor Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html). My research area is NLP X HCI. <span style="color:rgb(226, 17, 17);"> Outside of work and research, I’m counting down the days until a little ball of fluff named [Yummi](https://xzhan0.github.io/yummi/) — a Ragdoll kitten — moves in and takes over my apartment. 🐾✨ </span>
