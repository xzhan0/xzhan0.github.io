To be updated on Nov. 14

I am interested in the intersection of AI and human-computer interaction. Currently I have two research lines in AI: <span style="color: #FF69B4; font-weight: bold;">1. Scalable language model applications for content moderation. 2. LLM based modular code generation frameworks. </span> And I am also interested in developing multi-agent systems for these research lines.

I have multiple internship experience in Industry for sotfware and AI development ([NeuroMesh](https://www.nmesh.io/), *undisclosed startup*) and Academia for nlp and hci research ([UIUC](https://oncare.cs.illinois.edu/), [Tsinghua University](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [NCSA](https://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/23-24-academic-year-interns/)).

**I am actively seeking <s>SWE/MLE internships and</s> research internship opportunities for summer 2025. Contact me (xianyangzhan@gmail.com, zhan39@illinois.edu) if you think I will be a good fit for a role in your team.**
