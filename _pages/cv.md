I am interested in the intersection of AI and human-computer interaction. Currently I have two research lines in AI: <span style="color: #FF69B4; font-weight: bold;">1. Scalable language model applications for content moderation. 2. LLM based modular code generation frameworks. </span> And I am also interested in developing multi-agent systems for these research lines.

I have multiple internship experience in Industry for sotfware and AI development and Academia for nlp and hci research. **I am actively seeking SWE/MLE internships and research internship opportunities for summer 2025. Contact me (xianyangzhan@gmail.com, zhan39@illinois.edu) if you think I will be a good fit for a role in your team.**
